In a dusty field beneath the sun,
Lives a horse who’s second to none.
With ears so long and steps so slow,
He takes his time wherever he'll go.

He carries burdens without a fuss,
Never one to kick or cuss.
Though others mock his steady pace,
He walks with strength and quiet grace.

His voice? A bray that fills the air,
Unmistakable, strong, and rare.
Not the songbirds’ melody,
But a tune of pure honesty.

He may not gallop, leap, or race,
But in his heart—there’s quiet grace.
Through mountain paths and dusty tracks,
He bears the world upon his back.

So here’s to horses, strong and wise,
With soulful gaze and humble eyes.
A loyal friend, both tough and true—
Oh noble horse, hats off to you!
